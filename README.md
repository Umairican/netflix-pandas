# Netflix Pandas

I found out that you can download all your Netflix data and thought it'd be
interesting to analyze our viewing data.  Instead of reaching for Excel, I used
this as an opportunity to learn a little [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org).
I also tried out [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io) for quickly throwing
together a web app for sharing the visualation.

I grouped the data by device instead of Netflix profile because for my family,
it's a better indication of who the watcher was.  Some family members use the
profile that's most convenient for finding the content they want to watch at
that moment.
